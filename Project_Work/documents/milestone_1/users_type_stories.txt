
The support team at the IITM BSc degree program often get overwhelmed with 
emails from students regarding queries and concerns.


Primary : Students, Support Team
Secondary : Software developers, Admins
Tertiary : IIT Madras (For Funding the software dev process), App hosting platforms like Heroku, Replit, Future Students (for FAQ access)

 Your task is to create an online support ticketing system for the IITM BSc degree program. 
 Students can create a support ticket for a particular concern or query. Before they create a 
ticket, the system should also show a list of similar tickets, and allow users to like 
or +1 an already existing support ticket, so that duplicates are not created. This 
way popular concerns or queries can be prioritised by the support team.

After the support team addresses the concern, they can mark the ticket as resolved, 
and an appropriate notification should be sent to concerned users.
Another important feature of the ticketing system is dynamic FAQ updation. Many 
student concerns can be FAQs which will be useful for future students. If appropriate, 
the support query and response should be added to the FAQ section by support 
admins, and appropriately categorised, so that an updated FAQ will be readily available 
to students. The platform should allow users to enroll as students, support staff and 
admins.
Apart from these standard requirements, you can also think of other features which can 
add value to users.
